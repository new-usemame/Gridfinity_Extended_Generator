# Git Anonymous Commits Rule

When committing and pushing changes to git in this project:

1. **Always configure git to use anonymous identity before committing:**
   ```bash
   git config user.name "anonymous"
   git config user.email "anonymous@users.noreply.github.com"
   ```

2. **Never use these names/usernames:**
   - Condo97
   - acoundou
   - Alex
   - Any variation of the above

3. **Always push to the `origin` remote** which is configured to use the anonymous GitHub account (new-usemame)

4. **Commit message format:** Use clear, descriptive commit messages without any personal identifiers
